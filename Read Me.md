Background check reading your clipboard and pasted into a richtextbox and write to a text file; just in-case the window crashes. 
Each day it will create a new .txt file under a folder on your desktop called \Clipboards.





You can also copy pictures!


When you right click and copy a picture a directory will be created to store your images under the parent \Clipboards.
The pictures will be stored as a png.
